# Pi Env

Pi Env runs Pi's tools in a Docker container or on an SSH host, while Pi
itself stays local.

```bash
pi install git:github.com/tshu-w/pi-env
```

## Usage

```bash
pi --env docker:[user@]container[:/path]
pi --env ssh:[user@]host[:/path]
```

Without a path, the working directory is the user's home. In a session,
`/env` shows the current environment, `/env <environment>` switches, and
`/env off` returns to local execution.

Built-in tools and user `!` commands run in the environment, and paths are
paths there. Project context files such as `AGENTS.md` are read from the
environment. The environment is saved with the session. If `--env` cannot be
reached, tools fail instead of running locally.

## Requirements

The environment needs POSIX `sh`, and `setsid` or `perl`; grep also needs
`rg`. Locally, `docker` or `ssh`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Tests use an `alpine:3` container and `ssh localhost` (`PI_ENV_TEST_SSH`
sets another host), and skip what is unavailable.
